# Solat API - An API to get prayer times for Malaysia (data scrap from JAKIM)

This API is publicly open at https://solatapi.fajarhac.com/v2/.

Full documentation can be viewed in https://solatapi.fajarhac.com/api

## Self host

You can get the code and run on your server. But I make the docker image publicly available.
Database is in JSON file and available in the source code, so you do not have setting anything.
Just pull the docker image and run.

[Docker image for SolatAPI](https://github.com/users/fakhrullah/packages/container/package/solatapi/solatapi)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/fakhrullah/solatapi/solatapi:2.1.0
```
